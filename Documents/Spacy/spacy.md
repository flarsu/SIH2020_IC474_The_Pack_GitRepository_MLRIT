# Facts and Figures of Spacy model

##### Comparison between time and accuracy

Two peer-reviewed papers in 2015 confirmed that spaCy offers the **fastest syntactic parser in the world** and that **its accuracy is within 1% of the best** available. The few systems that are more accurate are 20Ã— slower or more.

#### Parse Accuracy

**Parsing in NLP** is the process of determining the syntactic structure of a text by analyzing its constituent words based on an underlying grammar (of the language).

#### Detailed Speed Comparison

Here we compare the per-document processing time of various spaCy functionalities against other NLP libraries. We show both absolute timings (in ms) and relative performance (normalized to spaCy). Lower is better.
